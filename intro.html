                HTML specifies elements that divide a document into descriptive and functional parts. Each HTML document must be tagged with the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag, 
                which indicates the type of document (which version of html we use). Another pair of required tags are &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt;. These tags specify the 
                beginning and end of the HTML document. If desired, we can insert the title tags &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt;, they contain information about the document, 
                which is not displayed with the main text. The &lt;title&gt; Title &lt;/title&gt; element is most commonly used in the title part of the document, which marks the 
                title of the HTML document. If this item is used, the title of the document is displayed in the title bar of the browser window. We can also put the 
                &lt;style&gt; and &lt;/style&gt;, where we can add a link to another css or javascript file, or enter our css code directly to format the page. The 
                executable part is located between the &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; tags, which mark the beginning and end of the body and are located after 
                the &lt;/head&gt; tag. Elements can contain attributes, these attributes have the meaning of a property of the element and serve for its visual design.

                        A HTML heading or HTML h tag can be defined as a title or a subtitle which you want to display on the webpage. ... h1 is the largest heading tag and h6 is the smallest one.
